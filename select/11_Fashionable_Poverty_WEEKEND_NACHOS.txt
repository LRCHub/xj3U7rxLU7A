You motherfucker, you fucking fucker
You smell worse than a hobo
But you've got more money than us all
Your ignorant fucking lifestyle
Is a death-deserving crime
I'll shave your fucking dreads
And throw you on the street

Strip you of the good life
You've pretended to throw away

And you'll wish you were never fucking born
