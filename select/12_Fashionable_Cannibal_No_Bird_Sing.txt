The gentleman's a patient wolf
Playing doctor for a flock of sheep
With two tone ethics and amphetamine speak
I'm not the problem, I'm just the next in line
They won't fix the ride
No matter how many broken necks they find
With a blessed mind and a bleeding chest
I humbly swear to protect the bottom line with my dying breath
By the time you realize the money's dyed soylent green
You'll rely on it so much, you'll think it's natural
To optimize collateral damages
Fashionable cannibal, Hated those people anyway
How deep? Deeper than your selfish
Catch you on the way down
Your welcome for the head trip

Predator Drone
Bank loan
Dead time

Empty angel consumed
By the weatherman's prediction of snow in the afternoon
Don't act confused about the lonely in the mass grave
7 billion strong and I'm pressed to recall a present face
Stagger in the afterglow
Yes it feels fragile, but once your perception shatters
It won't matter what store the mannequin went
To get his swagger from
So many voices in your brain is a stagnant hum
Pass go
Collect your capsule
Chemical lasso
Sleeping on your feet is a hassle
Breathing ether with the actors on the stage is so amazing, here
Sit and read this script until you're famous
How deep? Gotta fear lobotomy, bottom's calling me
Gotta go
Sinking slow with a soma drone
Fix is the solution
Floating and totally sober
Home alone and stoned virtual
Really like the company
Vertigo was worth it
One thing is for certain
Defining your position is a symptom of a sick mind
On both sides of the curtain
