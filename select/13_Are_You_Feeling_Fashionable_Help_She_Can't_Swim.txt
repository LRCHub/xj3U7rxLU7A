Give me a rock'n'roll slogan to scream
And put me on the cover of Bang Magazine
And do you sell more copies than melody maker
Do you sell more copies than melody maker

God bless the music press
Cause they made you believe that The Strokes are the best
And, no, you're not bored of it yet
I can't believe you're not bored of it yet

Yeah, you've got a clique, you've got alternachic
We don't like your records, just want to come here

And I want a haircut that says who I am
And I want some plimsoles that says who I am
And I want a t-shirt that says who I am
And I want a satchel that says who I am
And I want some turnups that says who I am

Fuck your band
Suck our band
Fuck your band
Suck our band
Fuck your band
Suck our band
Fuck your band
Suck our band
