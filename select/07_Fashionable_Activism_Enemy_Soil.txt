Explain to me
How supporting your shit band
Helps your cause
I don't see the connection
Forgive me, but lining the pockets
Of your parent company doesn't liberate
The oppressed people of the world
Pat yourself on the back
For preaching on deaf ears
Increase your social status
Among your rich and famous peers
Save your fashionable activism for someone who cares
You're educating no one
