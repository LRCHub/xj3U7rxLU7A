An invitation to a party begs you go
You'll wear the only thing that
Waits inside your door
No red, no green
One black dress is all
Any woman needs
My, aren't we fashionable?

Calls made
Your ride awaits
You've dressed your lips in rose
The powder on your face
Who else could get so close

Refuse directions
You have memorized the road
Back when you chased the trends
Some picture always told

No red, no green
One black dress is all
Any woman needs
My, aren't we fashionable?

Who will sweep you off your feet?
Who will sweep you off your feet?

You've made the great escape
With only one goodbye
Your stream of consciousness
It floods into the night
The boy's predictable
The girls may never know
The beauty that you wear
Way underneath your clothes

No red, no green
One black dress is all
Any woman needs
My, aren't we fashionable?

Who will sweep you off your feet?
Who will sweep you off your feet?

Role models pile up in the street
She has survived just a
Scratch on the cheek
She's paying in dimes
A midnight coffee shrink

Her shoulder's exposed
She holds a cup like a queen
From some tiny ancient island country
Off the coast of Greece
Where the daughters will
All have names like Elise

The lighting in here is terrible
A weird glowing green
And flattery won't get her
Out of her seat
She digs in her heels
Her mascara streaks
Who's gonna sweep her off?

Why didn't I, why?
A hundred miles deep
Who's gonna sweep her off of her feet?
A skeptic at heart
But why shouldn't she be?
Who's gonna sweep her off?

When every mouth lies
And every hand cheats
Good luck sweeping her off of her feet
With those x-ray eyes
And see the wolf in the sheep
But who's gonna sweep her off?

I am your style
Oh, and you are my style
And I am your style
And you - are - my - style

Who will sweep you
Off your feet?
Who will sweep you
Off your feet?
Who will sweep you
Off your feet?
